👋 Hello World, I’m Alex.
- 🐺 Northeastern University COE undergrad
- 🌱 Loading new gap year projects...
- 🌲In my last robotics season as a high school student, I specialized in programming [fiducial marker detection](https://github.com/FRCTeam1073-TheForceTeam/nanovision2023) (AprilTag family #16h5) for 1073's 2023 competition robot, assisted with [trajectory commands, localization, swerve drive tuning, and autonomous routines](https://github.com/FRCTeam1073-TheForceTeam/robot2023), and passed the torch (tupperware box of wires, cameras, and LiDAR taken *off* the stick) to the new subgroup members. It's been real y'all <3
