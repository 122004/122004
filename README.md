👋 Hello World, I’m Alex.
- 🐺 NEU COE
- In my last robotics season as a high school student, I specialized in programming [fiducial marker detection](https://github.com/FRCTeam1073-TheForceTeam/nanovision2023) (AprilTag family #16h5) for 1073's competition robot, assisted with [trajectory commands, localization, swerve drive tuning, and autonomous routines](https://github.com/FRCTeam1073-TheForceTeam/robot2023), and passed the torch (LiDAR taken *off* the stick) to the new subgroup members. It's been real y'all <3
- Right now I'm in Cornerstone of Engineering 1 (updating this in class haha) applying the processes, engineering methods, and programming techniques learned through the FIRST robotics program. Feel free to reach out to talk abut the work I'm doing in C++/Arduino, or after our semester 1 project concludes in December 2024, our final submission (Hi, Sophia and Katie!! <3 ).
