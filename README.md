👋 Hello World, I’m Alex.
- 🐺 NEU COE
- In my last robotics season as a high school student, I specialized in programming [fiducial marker detection](https://github.com/FRCTeam1073-TheForceTeam/nanovision2023) (AprilTag family #16h5) for 1073's 2023 competition robot, assisted with [trajectory commands, localization, swerve drive tuning, and autonomous routines](https://github.com/FRCTeam1073-TheForceTeam/robot2023), and passed the torch (LiDAR taken *off* the stick) to the new subgroup members. It's been real y'all <3
- Right now I'm in Cornerstone of Engineering 1 (updating this in class LOL) applying the processes, engineering methods, and programming techniques learned through FIRST. Reach out to see the work I'm doing in C++/Arduino, or after the December 2024 semester 1 project, our final submission (Hi, Katie!! <3 ).
